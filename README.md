Plinko is a small game project built using JavaScript that explores basic physics-style movement and randomness.
The project simulates falling objects and interactions with obstacles, helping me experiment with motion, gravity-like behavior, and simple calculations.

What I worked on
- JavaScript logic for movement
- Simulating simple physics-based behavior
- Experimenting with randomness and positioning

This project allowed me to explore how mathematical ideas can be applied in programming.
